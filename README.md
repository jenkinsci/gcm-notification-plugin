# Google Cloud Messaging notifications for Jenkins

Lets Jenkins push build result notifications directly to your Android device, using Google's free Cloud Messaging service.

Check out [buildwatch.org](http://buildwatch.org/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=plugin) for more information, and download the Android app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crowflying.buildwatch&referrer=utm_source%3Dgithub%26utm_medium%3Dreadme%26utm_content%3Dplugin).  
If you have a Sony SmartWatch, build results can also be sent direct direct to your watch!

The plugin provides plenty of inline help, but you can also check out a setup guide and videos at [buildwatch.org/setup.html](http://buildwatch.org/setup.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=plugin).
